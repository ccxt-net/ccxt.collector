# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Important**: 
1. Always read and understand the documentation files in the `docs/` folder to maintain comprehensive knowledge of the project. These documents contain critical information about the project's architecture, implementation details, and version history.
2. After completing each task or implementation, immediately update the relevant documentation to reflect the changes. Keep all documentation synchronized with the current state of the codebase.

## Project Overview

CCXT.Collector is a .NET library that connects to cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide via WebSocket to receive real-time market data (orderbook, trades, ticker, etc.) and delivers it to callback functions using unified data classes. Additionally, it analyzes the data per exchange and market to calculate technical indicators in real-time, providing these indicator values through callbacks. This allows developers to handle both raw market data and technical analysis from different exchanges with a consistent interface.

   - `TimeExtension.cs` - Time-related extension methods
   - `LinqExtension.cs` - LINQ extensions
   - `Statistics.cs` - Statistical calculations
   - `logger.cs` - Logging utilities

5. **Exchange Implementations** (`src/exchanges/`): Each exchange has:
   - **WebSocket Client** (e.g., `BinanceWebSocketClient.cs`) - Real-time data streaming
   - **Callback Events**: OnOrderbookReceived, OnTradeReceived, OnTickerReceived, etc.


### WebSocket-based Data Flow Architecture

1. **WebSocket Connection**: 
   - Each exchange has dedicated WebSocket client (e.g., `BinanceWebSocketClient`)
   - Automatic connection management with reconnection support
   - Exchange-specific WebSocket URL and protocol handling

2. **Subscription Management**:
   - Subscribe to specific channels: `SubscribeOrderbookAsync()`, `SubscribeTradesAsync()`, `SubscribeTickerAsync()`
   - Per-symbol subscription with unified interface across exchanges
   - Automatic resubscription on reconnection

3. **Data Reception & Processing**:
   - Raw WebSocket messages processed by exchange-specific handlers
   - Exchange format converted to unified data classes (`SOrderBooks`, `SCompleteOrders`, `STicker`)
   - Incremental updates handled appropriately (orderbook deltas, trade streams)

4. **Callback Delivery**:
   - Direct callback invocation for real-time data delivery
   - Event-driven architecture with typed callbacks for each data type
   - No intermediate queuing - direct delivery to registered handlers

5. **Technical Analysis** (Optional):
   - Calculates technical indicators using received market data
   - Per-exchange and per-market indicator calculation
   - Delivered through same callback mechanism

6. **Error Handling & Recovery**:
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Error callbacks for monitoring connection health
   - Subscription state management across reconnections

### Real-time Technical Analysis Flow

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collects OHLCV data per exchange and market symbol
2. **Indicator Calculation**: Updates indicator values with each new data point
3. **Series Management**: Maintains historical series data required for indicator calculations
4. **Callback Triggers**: Sends calculated indicator values to registered callbacks
5. **Performance Optimization**: Uses efficient algorithms to minimize calculation overhead

### Key Dependencies

- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration**: Configuration management
- **System.Text.Json**: JSON support

### Configuration

The application uses `appsettings.json` for configuration:
- Exchange-specific settings (polling intervals, snapshot counters)
- Auto-start configuration for exchanges and symbols
- WebSocket retry settings and reconnection parameters

### Key Features

- **Real-time WebSocket Streaming**: Primary method for receiving market data with minimal latency
- **Unified Data Classes**: All exchanges return data in the same format, simplifying multi-exchange integration
- **Callback-based Architecture**: Register callbacks to handle incoming data asynchronously
- **Real-time Technical Indicators**: Calculates and delivers technical indicator values per exchange/market
- **Multi-indicator Support**: Over 25 technical indicators available for real-time analysis
- **Automatic Reconnection**: WebSocket connections automatically reconnect on disconnection (10 retry attempts, exponential backoff up to 60s)
- **Incremental Orderbook Updates**: Efficiently processes orderbook deltas to maintain current state
- **Per-market Analysis**: Independent indicator calculation for each exchange and trading pair
- **High Performance**: System.Text.Json for 20-30% faster parsing, 15-25% less memory usage

### Critical Issues (As of 2025-08-12 Analysis)

- **🔴 Security**: Plain text API key storage - needs secure credential management implementation
- **🟢 Testing**: 100% test coverage for major exchanges with unified test suite
- **🟠 Error Handling**: Single parse failure triggers full reconnection - needs threshold
- **🟠 Performance**: Buffer management can be optimized with ArrayPool<byte>
- **🟠 Observability**: Limited metrics injection for channel statistics

### Exchange-Specific Notes

- **Binance**: Full WebSocket support for all market data streams
- **Upbit**: WebSocket for real-time data, REST API fallback available
- **Bitmex**: WebSocket with position and margin trading data streams
- **Deribit**: WebSocket using JSON-RPC protocol for derivatives
- **Bithumb, Gemini, ItBit**: WebSocket implementations for spot trading

### Target Frameworks

The project targets both .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0, allowing compatibility with different runtime environments.
